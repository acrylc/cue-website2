Their technology reduces waste allowing hospitals to invest in improved patient care.</div><div class="side right"><strong>TeleTracking software improves hospitals in many ways.</strong> TeleTracking offers solutions that help hospitals handle patient transfers; so incoming patients are not turned away because of capacity concerns. Inside the hospital, TeleTracking offers solutions to track patients and hospital assets so patients receive prompt treatment. TeleTracking also helps hospitals fight infection by automating infection alert protocols. These automated alerts limit exposure so infections are less likely to spread throughout the hospital.</div></div></section><section class=image id=image1></section><section id=our-client><div class=inner><div class=title>MHCI + Our Project</div><div class="side left"><strong>The Carnegie Mellon Human-Computer Interaction Institute is an inter-disciplinary community of students and faculty dedicated to research and education in topics related to computer technology in support of human activity and society.</strong> The master’s program is a rigorous 12-month curriculum in which students complete coursework in programming, design, psychology, HCI methods, and electives that allow them to personalize their educational experience. During their second and third semesters, the students participate in a substantial Capstone Project with an industry sponsor.</div><div class="side right"><strong>The Capstone Project course curriculum is structured to cover the end-to-end process of a research and development product cycle.</strong> Students work closely with an industry sponsor on new ideas or applications that may work with their existing human-to-machine technology. The goal of this 32-week course is to give each student the opportunity for a “real-life” industry project, similar to an actual experience in a research, design, and development setting. Company sponsors benefit from the innovative ideas produced by the students, to fix existing systems or reach into new markets.</div></div></section><section id=focus><div class=inner><div class=title>Our Focus</div><div class=blurb>Our project focuses on creating a HIPAA-compliant mobile application that provides meaningful status updates and interactions for families waiting for a loved one in surgery.
