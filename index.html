Their technology reduces waste allowing hospitals to invest in improved patient care.</div><div class="side right"><strong>TeleTracking software improves hospitals in many ways.</strong> TeleTracking offers solutions that help hospitals handle patient transfers; so incoming patients are not turned away because of capacity concerns. Inside the hospital, TeleTracking offers solutions to track patients and hospital assets so patients receive prompt treatment. TeleTracking also helps hospitals fight infection by automating infection alert protocols. These automated alerts limit exposure so infections are less likely to spread throughout the hospital.</div></div></section><section class=image id=image1></section><section id=our-client><div class=inner><div class=title>MHCI + Our Project</div><div class="side left"><strong>The Carnegie Mellon Human-Computer Interaction Institute is an inter-disciplinary community of students and faculty dedicated to research and education in topics related to computer technology in support of human activity and society.</strong> The master’s program is a rigorous 12-month curriculum in which students complete coursework in programming, design, psychology, HCI methods, and electives that allow them to personalize their educational experience. During their second and third semesters, the students participate in a substantial Capstone Project with an industry sponsor.</div><div class="side right"><strong>The Capstone Project course curriculum is structured to cover the end-to-end process of a research and development product cycle.</strong> Students work closely with an industry sponsor on new ideas or applications that may work with their existing human-to-machine technology. The goal of this 32-week course is to give each student the opportunity for a “real-life” industry project, similar to an actual experience in a research, design, and development setting. Company sponsors benefit from the innovative ideas produced by the students, to fix existing systems or reach into new markets.</div></div></section><section id=focus><div class=inner><div class=title>Our Focus</div><div class=blurb>Our project focuses on creating a HIPAA-compliant mobile application that provides meaningful status updates and interactions for families waiting for a loved one in surgery.

We chose seven of the ideas with high benefit to families for low cost to validate through speed dating. Sixteen participants helped us validate these ideas.


(This intro paragraph is optional)
We went through 8 rounds of prototyping for this project. After each round of testing, we updated our designs based on feedback from participants. Participants provided insights that we as designers didn’t consider due to our expert knowledge of the system.

We started prototyping with paper because paper prototypes are cost-effective and easy to make. By presenting participants with these low-fidelity prototypes, we were able to get feedback focused on the functionality of the prototype rather than the design.</div><div id=mid-fi class="side right dside"><strong>Mid-Fidelity: Interactive Wireframes</strong> Our mid-fidelity prototypes were partially-interactive wireframes that test participants could use on a smart phone. We performed three round of testing with our mid-fi prototypes: one in a hospital and two in our lab. A total of sixteen participants tested these prototypes. We continued task-driven think-alouds and we asked our survey questions to participants in the first and third rounds of our mid-fidelity tests. We also added a couple of methods along the way. Our second round included a feature naming activity. We began cad sorts with participants in the third round to understand the relative importance of features and how much informational detail is desired.</div><div id=hi-fi class="side right dside"><strong>High-Fidelity: Functioning App</strong> Although they started out similar to our final mid-fidelity prototype, our high-fidelity prototypes eventually became fully functional and fully designed. We completed three rounds of testing with our high-fi prototypes, one in our lab and two at hospitals. A total of fourteen family members tested these prototypes. We continued think-alouds and surveys throughout the rounds and continued card sorts for one round. We also had the opportunity to get the perspective of six hospital workers during speed dating sessions.</div></div></section><section id=team><div class=inner><div class=title>Team</div><div class=mini-blurb><div>We are an interdisciplinary team of engineers, designers and researchers.</div><br><div>We are passionate about designing beautiful human experiences.</div></div><div id=team-container><div id=team-members><div id=maya class=team-member><img src=images/team/maya.jpg></div><div id=julie class=team-member><img src=images/team/julie.jpg></div><br><div id=sabrina class=team-member><img src=images/team/sabrina.jpg></div><div id=nissa class=team-member><img src=images/team/nissa.jpg></div><div id=john class=team-member><img src=images/team/john.jpg></div></div><div class="profile out"></div></div></div></section><script type=text/template id=research-template><div class='meta'>
