During their second and third semesters, the students participate in a substantial Capstone Project with an industry sponsor.</div><div class="side right"><strong>The Capstone Project course curriculum is structured to cover the end-to-end process of a research and development product cycle.</strong> Students work closely with an industry sponsor on new ideas or applications that may work with their existing human-to-machine technology. The goal of this 32-week course is to give each student the opportunity for a “real-life” industry project, similar to an actual experience in a research, design, and development setting. Company sponsors benefit from the innovative ideas produced by the students, to fix existing systems or reach into new markets.</div></div></section><section id=focus><div class=inner><div class=title>Our Focus</div><div class=blurb>Our project focuses on creating a HIPAA-compliant mobile application that provides meaningful status updates and interactions for families waiting for a loved one in surgery.

We chose seven of the ideas with high benefit to families for low cost to validate through speed dating. Sixteen participants helped us validate these ideas.


(This intro paragraph is optional)
We went through 8 rounds of prototyping for this project. After each round of testing, we updated our designs based on feedback from participants. Participants provided insights that we as designers didn’t consider due to our expert knowledge of the system.

We started prototyping with paper because paper prototypes are cost-effective and easy to make. By presenting participants with these low-fidelity prototypes, we were able to get feedback focused on the functionality of the prototype rather than the design.</div><div id=mid-fi class="side right dside"><strong>Mid-Fidelity: Interactive Wireframes</strong> were partially-interactive prototypes that test participants could use on a smart phone. We performed three rounds of testing with our mid-fi prototypes: one in a hospital and two in our lab. A total of sixteen participants tested these prototypes. We evaluated our designs using task-driven think-alouds and survey questions. The survey questions were used to evaluate the app’s effect on participant’s anxiety and obligation to stay in the waiting room. Additionally, we used card sorts to understand feature importance and we created our own Jeopardy! style exercise to clarify feature names.</div><div id=hi-fi class="side right dside"><strong>High-Fidelity: Functioning App</strong> Our high-fidelity prototype was fully functional and fully designed. We completed three rounds of testing with our high-fi prototype, one in our lab and two in hospitals. A total of fourteen family members tested the prototype by completing tasks while thinking aloud. We stopped using card sorts in the interest of lessening the time-commitment for families in hospitals as we had exhausted the usefulness of the technique. To test the prototype, we used a Wizard of Oz system that allowed us to remotely control the app while participants completed tasks. We also used our hospital access to get the perspective of six hospital workers through speed dating sessions with the actual prototype.</div></div></section><section id=team><div class=inner><div class=title>Team</div><div class=mini-blurb><div>We are an interdisciplinary team of engineers, designers and researchers.</div><br><div>We are passionate about designing beautiful human experiences.</div></div><div id=team-container><div id=team-members><div id=maya class=team-member><img src=images/team/maya.jpg></div><div id=julie class=team-member><img src=images/team/julie.jpg></div><br><div id=sabrina class=team-member><img src=images/team/sabrina.jpg></div><div id=nissa class=team-member><img src=images/team/nissa.jpg></div><div id=john class=team-member><img src=images/team/john.jpg></div></div><div class="profile out"></div></div></div></section><script type=text/template id=research-template><div class='meta'>
